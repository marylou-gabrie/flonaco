 *Adaptive Monte Carlo augmented with normalizing flows*, M. Gabri√©, G. Rotskoff and E. Vanden-Eijnden. 

The back-bone of the code is contained in the ``flonaco`` python package. It will help you accelerate sampling of multimodal measures combining traditional Langevin and Real-NVPs normalizing flow trained on the fly.

## Installation
